# learn-in-public

A repository to chronicle my notes on my journey to [#LearnInPublic](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23LearnInPublic&src=hashtag_click).

The motivation for this came about after stumbling upon [@swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx) on Twitter. I'm hoping that it will help keep me accountable and push me to continue expanding my knowledge base.

The repo will contain my notes from reading articles, completing courses, and anything else from my learning journey that I'd like to share.

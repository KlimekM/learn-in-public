# basecs

This folder contains my notes from reading through the [basecs-series](https://github.com/vaidehijoshi/basecs-series) by [Vaidehi](https://twitter.com/vaidehijoshi).

Some of my notes are rewordings of the content in the original posts which helps me cement the information that is being presented. All credit goes to Vaidehi for the wonderful content and helping me level up my base CS knowledge.

I will be going through each of the articles in the series in order and chronicaling my notes here.

I encourage you to read through the articles yourself, but feel free to check out my notes if you find them at all helpful.
